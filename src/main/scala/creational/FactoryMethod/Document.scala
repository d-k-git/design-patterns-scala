package creational.FactoryMethod

/**
 * The Factory Method pattern defines an interface (Creator) for creating objects,
 * but it allows subclasses (concrete creators) to decide which (—Åoncrete product) class to instantiate
 *
 *  The FM pattern is suitable for tasks where:
    - a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create (e.g. the class is created in runtime)
    - a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
    - classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses,
      and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate. (GoF, Design Patterns)
